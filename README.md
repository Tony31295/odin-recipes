# odin-recipes
Created a website, that contains 4 different pages. 
The index site has a title "Odin Recipes" as directed by the project instruction, as well as 3 links to different recipes. The recipes are ordered using a unordered list for better formatting
Each recipe has its own web page. All pages have a title, a picture of the finished product, headers, list of ingredients, and steps to cook the recipes
